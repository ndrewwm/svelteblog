If you've talked shop with me over the past 6 months, you've probably heard me mention that I've been working on standing up dbt at work. In relation to these efforts, I went to Coalesce 2024 this year with one of my colleagues from Denver. This was the first professional conference I've attended since 2018 (possibly earlier). Given I work remotely, it was great to be able to share conversation and meals outside of a Teams meeting.  I'm very grateful to my organization for supporting our professional development by enabling us to attend.

So, why go to Coalesce? We're very early in our rollout of *dbt core*, a free/open source framework for transforming, testing, and documenting data within data warehouse environments. Coalesce is hosted by dbtLabs (the maintainers of dbt core, and its associated cloud product, *dbt cloud*), and is a 4-day conference where new features are announced and practitioners are able to give/attend talks about how their organizations are using dbt. Given that we're on relatively novel terrain, I've been interested in talking to other teams/users at all different stages of adoption. Here are a few of my broad observations, drawn from a mix of presentations and personal conversations:

**Hybrid approaches (i.e., organizations using both core and cloud) were much more common than I expected.** I had first learned about dbt in maybe 2018 and 2019, when I was still a data analyst. The framework's guiding principles have resonated strongly with me, but I'd increasingly encountered rumors that the cloud service is very expensive. Coming into the conference, I assumed we'd encounter teams/organizations in basically two camps: those using dbt core exclusively, and those that had made the leap to dbt cloud. Perhaps we'd find a few organizations in the middle that were in transition, but I expected this set to be pretty outnumbered. Instead, I'm not sure if we actually encountered any shops (like us) working exclusively with dbt core. Perhaps this isn't that surprising, given that Coalesce is an industry conference-- most of the attendees are likely to be already fairly committed to the framework. But, it felt notable that a good chunk of the groups we encountered didn't have every member of their team working in the cloud product.

**It seems like dbt usually takes root in an organization's data engineering team.** There are many different ways that an organization might come to adopt dbt; one of the commonly discussed narratives I encountered early via blog posts outlines the story of a "data team of one" building out a fresh organization's data platform. These posts resonated with me in 2019, and while I didn't end up embarking on implementing dbt in my role at the time, I was able to see how this was possible for small teams to achieve a lot. Flash forward to 2024, I think our experience might be more typical, at least for the mix of attendees we encountered.
