My blog/website is built using SvelteKit, a framework for web development that helps users write.

The code for my website can be [found here.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/svelteblog/) Being able to read other's source code has been a huge part of my own learning, it's only fair that I pass on that opportunities to others. I was influenced by the following people while developing the overall look/feel of my website.

- [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/about-me): Josh's website is beautiful, and I'm indebted to his [tutorial](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) on building a blog using SvelteKit. Stumbling across it was a big part of my ability to get a skeleton project off the ground.

- [Min Park](https://staedi.github.io/): Min's website is aesthetically clean and polished. When thinking about the layout and routing for my own website, I had planned on minimalistic feel that looked nice with a dark color scheme. I was inspired by Min's approach, particularly with how their navbar was set up.

- [The folks who built mdsvex](https://mdsvex.com/): while I'm stretching into working more with HTML directly, having the *option* to write in Markdown was super important to me. It's my favorite approach to authoring content to be consumed on the web; being able to pair it with Svelte/SvelteKit was a no-brainer.

- [Matt Jennings](https://mattjennings.io/): I'm indebted to Matt's [plugin](https://github.com/mattjennings/mdsvex-relative-images) which lets you use relative image URLs when writing content in mdsvex. Matt's template sveltekit blog was also useful for some pointers.

- [The folks behind Quarto](https://quarto.org/): speaking of markdown, I'm still an R-user that likes building visualizations using ggplot. Quarto is a first-class tool for literate programming, and if you're seeing R-code in one of my posts, it's virtually certain that the page you're reading is output from `quarto`.
