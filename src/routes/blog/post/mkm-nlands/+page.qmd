I'm playing in the MKM Arena Open tomorrow; the day 2 event is best-of-three (Bo3) draft. A classic question for a given limited format in Magic is how many lands a player should be running in their list. This isn't a simple question to answer, and depends on the kind of deck that's been drafted. However, I wanted to see if there were any patterns that have emerged over the lifetime of the set since it was released last month.

For this analysis, I've used game data from [17lands.com](https://17lands.com/), and tallied the number of basic lands and [nonbasic](https://scryfall.com/search?q=set:mkm+type:land+-type:basic) lands that a player has included in their list (by game). I've excluded any games where a player submitted a deck with more than 18 lands; the decision to run 19 is atypical for any limited format. This exclusion is about 400 games in total.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(vroom)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)

source("../../../../lib/assets/theme-ndrewwm.R")
theme_set(theme_ndrewwm())

df <- vroom("/Users/andrew/Downloads/game_data_public.MKM.TradDraft.csv.gz")

lands <- df |>
  select(
    draft_id,
    match_number,
    game_number,
    main_colors,
    splash_colors,
    on_play,
    num_mulligans,
    won,
    plains = deck_Plains,
    island = deck_Island,
    swamp = deck_Swamp,
    mountn = deck_Mountain,
    forest = deck_Forest,
    c0 = `deck_Branch of Vitu-Ghazi`,
    c1 = `deck_Scene of the Crime`,
    c2 = `deck_Public Thoroughfare`,
    c3 = `deck_Escape Tunnel`,
    c4 = `deck_Commercial District`,
    c5 = `deck_Elegant Parlor`,
    c6 = `deck_Hedge Maze`,
    c7 = `deck_Lush Portico`,
    c8 = `deck_Meticulous Archive`,
    c9 = `deck_Raucous Theater`,
    c10 = `deck_Shadowy Backstreet`,
    c11 = `deck_Thundering Falls`,
    c12 = `deck_Undercity Sewers`,
    c13 = `deck_Underground Mortuary`,
  )
```

```{r}
lands <- lands |>
  pivot_longer(plains:c12) |>
  group_by(
    draft_id,
    match_number,
    game_number,
    main_colors,
    splash_colors,
    on_play,
    num_mulligans,
    won,
  ) |>
  summarise(n_land = sum(value)) |>
  ungroup()

lands <- lands |>
  mutate(
    land_lvl = case_when(
      n_land == 17 ~ "17",
      n_land == 18 ~ "18",
      n_land > 18 ~ ">18",
      n_land < 17 ~ "16 (or less)",
      .default = ""
    )
  ) |>
  filter(n_land <= 18)
```

First, we have the overall performance, without regard for other factors (such as the colors in a player's deck). While the differences between our groups are pretty small, running a list with 17 lands has the highest rate of success. This is also the most common choice by far (approx. 79% of games are running a list with 17 lands).

```{r}
# per game basis
lands |>
  tabyl(land_lvl, won) |>
  adorn_totals(name = "Overall") |>
  adorn_percentages() |>
  adorn_pct_formatting() |>
  adorn_ns(position = "front") |>
  kable(col.names = c("# Lands", "Losses", "Wins"), align = "lrr")
```

Breaking apart the decks by colorpair, we see some hints that green decks might benefit from running 18. (Note, I'm excluding monocolor and 3+ color decks, but I'm not breaking out splashes.) Interestingly, it looks like only WB benefits from running 16 lands. Every red deck in the format gives up a lot of consistency (if not raw win %) for cutting lands.

```{r}
lands |>
  count(main_colors, land_lvl, won) |>
  filter(str_length(main_colors) == 2) |>
  mutate(land_lvl = fct_recode(land_lvl, `<17` = "16 (or less)")) |>
  group_by(main_colors, land_lvl) |>
  mutate(
    p = n / sum(n),
    q = 1 - p,
    N = sum(n),
    s = sqrt(p * q / n)
  ) |>
  filter(won) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = land_lvl)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, lty = "dashed") +
  geom_pointrange(aes(y = p, ymin = p - 1.96*s, ymax = p + 1.96*s), color = "#E1EFE6") +
  facet_wrap(~main_colors, nrow = 2) +
  labs(
    x = "# Lands in Deck",
    y = "Pr(Win | # Lands)",
    title = "In Bo3 MKM draft, running 17 lands appears to be a safe default.",
    subtitle = "Certain green decks (UG, BG, WG) might benefit from running 18.",
    caption = "95% CIs displayed | Plot: @ndrewwm | Data: 17lands.com"
  )
```

It seems particularly notable that WR doesn't seem to improve (on average) by cutting lands. You might expect that it could afford to do so, given its access to the best 1-drops in the format, such as *Novice Inspector*. However, *Novice Inspector* itself is instructive, given that the benefit it grants you for casting it requires additional mana to leverage. Given its popularity, I haven't been able to draft this deck frequently, but this result makes sense to me. In modern limited formats, it's difficult to overstate the importance of impacting the board early. However, not playing a land on turn 3 appears to be particularly punishing in MKM due to the *disguise* mechanic. Even in aggressive decks (like WR), you have to keep pace with your opponent along the mana curve. In terms of what's realistic for a given draft, there simply aren't enough cards that cost 2 mana or less to form enough of a core for one's deck.

In any case, the decision to run different land counts is complex, but running 17 appears to be about as solid of a default as one can rely on. It seems that green decks with 18 lands might be outperforming other builds in their colors, but you'll need some good intuition on whether your pool leans more towards the deck's theoretical ceiling to justify cutting an additional spell.
