While it starts somewhat slowly, I enjoyed this one. The book's plot is a bit of a mystery (told in the first person), with different figures in the narrator's community turning up dead. While you can spend some time speculating about the causes of the string of deaths, the meat of the book is its wandering through the mostly quiet rhythms of the narrator's life in rural Poland, and her thoughts about people, animals, William Blake, and astrology. Through its narrator, the book is committed to examining how humans casually (and frequently, cruelly) disregard the creatures that share the earth with us. Her voice is adamant and filled with a moral certainty that's refreshing, or at least interesting. If you're willing to be patient with the story, this one is worth picking up.
