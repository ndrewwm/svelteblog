# projects

Here are some things I'm working on in my spare time:

- I'm writing a browser-based clone of "Quiz & Dragons" called *Riddles & Wyverns*

- This site, source code found [here](https://github.com/ndrewwm/svelteblog)

- I post stuff occasionally on [my blog](/blog)

- My contributions to [#TidyTuesday]() visualizations

<!-- - I'm maintaining a dashboard of demographic figures about my [home state](/projects/idaho) -->
