I recommended this book during an annual party my friends host in which we bring a book that will be randomly sent home with a different attendee. The book feels uncluttered and compact. It's organized into an introductory chapter which covers the concept of the "digital poorhouse", a concluding chapter (holding recommendations for tech workers), with the middle sections being dedicated to three case studies: Indiana's disastrous automation of its Medicaid program's administration, LA's case management system used to assess need among unhoused people seeking shelter, and PA's predictive tools for gauging threats of potential incidences of child abuse & neglect. Eubanks is compelling in her observation that technologies used to surveil and control the poor are eventually adapted and deployed upon to the rest of society. Equally compelling is her point that many of these tools are threats to basic notions of human dignity, and equal participation in a democratic society.
