This was given to me as a Christmas gift. I'd describe this book as a guide to understanding how economics-related terminology appears in business news, with some standard explanations of marginal analysis and efficiencies offered from markets. It might be a bit too self certain for my taste; at times it feels more like an apology for capitalism, rather than a survey of a social science. I remember discovering the author was a contributor to <em>the Economist</em> and thinking that made sense. If you're wanting a broader view of the discipline, I think I would recommend <em>Economics: The User's Guide</em> by Ha-Joon Chang over this one.
