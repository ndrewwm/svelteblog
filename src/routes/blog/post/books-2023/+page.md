This year I tried to make sure I read at least 1 book per month. This was something I managed to do! Maybe we can do 18 in 2024. Here's what they were:

### *Desert Solitaire*, Edward Abbey

Abbey is a salty man, not always the most kind, but he wrote some beautiful things in here.

### *This is How You Lose the Time War*, Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone

Yes, we picked this one up due to the [viral tweets](). We listened to this one on a road trip. It was good! I enjoyed how the "written" correspondence between the two characters was used to tell the story. It was always fun to see where the next letter would be hidden.

### *The Age of Revolution, 1789-1848*, Eric J. Hobsbawm

This one I'd been slowly working through for the past year or so.

### *Boys Weekend*, Mattie Lubchansky

### *Red Plenty: Inside the Fifties' Soviet Dream*, Francis Spufford

### *Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism*, Safiya Umoja Noble

### *Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly*, Anthony Bourdain

Another audiobook I'd been working my way through. A classic, worth savoring. Wish he was still with us.

### *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor*, Virginia Eubanks

I recommended this book during an annual party my friends host in which we bring a book that will be randomly sent home with a different attendee. 

### *Females*, Andrea Long Chu

### *Beyond the Wall: East Germany, 1949-1990*, Katja Hoyer

### *Children of Time*, Adrian Tchaikovsky

### *Children of Ruin*, Adrian Tchaikovsky
