Mattie's comics are clever and funny, they were one of the reasons I subscribed to <em>the Nib</em> (now defunct, RIP). This is a graphic novel that follows a bachelor party gone <em>very wrong</em>, blending elements of cosmic horror and anticapitalist satire to poke at the hollowness of contemporary masculinity and certain aspects of male friendship.
