# Hello!

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a data engineer and data visualization specialist working from Boise, ID.

Currently I work within the Office of Information Technology at CU Boulder, within the office's data services team. I've previously worked at Boise State University, and the University of Michigan in several different developer, analyst, and research associate roles.

I have a degree in psychology from [the College of Idaho](collegeofidaho.edu), and am currently working on a second degree in Applied Mathematics from Boise State University. I'm interested in the intersection between social science and statistics, with topics such as survey research, public health, and data visualization being key areas of expertise.

- More information on my background can be found in my [resume.](/resume)
- I occasionally post on various topics, often data analysis and data visualization, on [my blog.](/blog)
- You can also check out some [projects](/projects) that I've developed as part of my portfolio.
