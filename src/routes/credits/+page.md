My blog/website is built using SvelteKit, a framework for web development that helps users write.

The code for my website can be [found here.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/svelteblog/) Being able to read other's source code has been a huge part of my own learning, it's only fair that I pass on that opportunities to others. I was influenced by the following people while developing the overall look/feel of my website.

- [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/about-me): Josh's website is beautiful, and I'm indebted to his [tutorial](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) on building a blog using SvelteKit. Stumbling across it was a big part of my ability to get a skeleton project off the ground.

- [Min Park](https://staedi.github.io/): Min's website is aesthetically clean and polished. It also has the benefit of being simple and well organized with regards to its layout (such as the navbar).

- [Matt Jennings](https://mattjennings.io/): they designed a plugin

- [The folks who built mdsvex](): having the *option* to write in Markdown was super important to me. It's my favorite approach to authoring content that's meant to be consumed on the web; being able to pair it with Svelte/SvelteKit was a no-brainer.

- [The folks behind Quarto](): speaking of markdown, I'm still an R-user that likes building visualizations using ggplot. Quarto is the first-class tool for serving literate programming that features analytical products from languages like Python and R. If you're seeing R-code in a blog post, it's virtually certain that the page you're reading is the output from `quarto`.
