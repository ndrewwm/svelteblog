Yes, we picked this one up due to the <a href="https://twitter.com/maskofbun/status/1655084850926473216">bigolas dickolas tweet</a> and listened to it on a road trip. It was good! I enjoyed how the "written" correspondence between the two characters was used to tell the story. It was always fun to see where the next letter would be hidden.
