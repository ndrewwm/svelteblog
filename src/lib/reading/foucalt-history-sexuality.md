This book is one of the places where Foucalt developed the concept of <em>biopower</em>. As states transitioned to modernity, duties of sovereignty expanded beyond determining the conditions of how subjects of the state might die (i.e., through enforcement of laws, conscription into wars, etc.). To sustain the industrial transition to capitalism, sovereignty also needed to be concerned with how subjects of the state live. Thus, states came to care about the concept (and health) of populations, entailing a more active role in managing reproduction. Foucalt argues that <em>sexuality</em>, as a concept and discursive tool, was used to assist with this task. Sexuality became the object of scientific and medical investigation, forming new discourses and categories of deviance. These ultimately helped states legitimize intervention into the private lives of their subjects, imposing discipline and conformity.

I never read much Foucault during college, but having finished this book, I wish I'd had the opportunity. I'm not sure if I'll continue reading the other 3 volumes in 2025, but I've gained a greater appreciation for why Foucault's concepts lurk in the background of many modern sociological works. Establishing a framework for investigating how and why modern societies seek to manage and discipline their subjects is incredibly useful. However, this doesn't make Foucalt's writing any easier to parse. I doubt it'd be easier going even if I could read the original French.
