# README

This is the GitHub repository for my personal site. It's built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and is hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com). For some features of the site, [Turso](https://turso.tech/) is used for database storage. I use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as an ORM to interact with a LibSQL client.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
