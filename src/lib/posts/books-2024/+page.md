      <em>The Illustrated Man</em>
    </div>
    <div class="subtitle is-size-5">
      Ray Bradbury (1951)
    </div>
    <p>Someone suggested this one for a book club I'm part of, and I was excited to have an excuse to pick it up. The book opens with an anonymous narrator allowing a travelling performer spend the night at his home. He discovers that the perfomer is covered with tattoos that seem to move (impossibly) over the performer's body. Each chapter from the book is a "scene" leaping from the performer's tattooed skin. The plots/characters are unconnected; I remember reading that Bradbury wrote them for magazine publication, and that they were later collected as this small volume.</p>
    <p>A story from this book that folks might know is "The Veldt", which I first learned about back in college from a classic <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5sGIgGkeYiiWdN0NVYJZ0I?si=8b83240290b344c0">deadmau5 track.</a> The story follows a family living in what we might now call a "smart house", which takes care of any of the inhabitants needs that you might imagine. The family's two children, Peter and Wendy, are obsessed with their holodeck-esque "nursery" which generates immersive virtual realities for them. The parents, George and Lydia, become increasingly concerned with how fixated the children have become with the entertainment system. I won't spill much more, but these outlines likely feel eerily contemporary to a society that's wracked with concerns over the impact of technology on its young people, and our widespread anomie more generally. Bradbury seems to have anticipated anxieties that still haunt us nearly a century later; a mark of good sci-fi, if you ask me.</p>

      David Graeber (2011)

    <p>This is the book I brought to an annual holiday party hosted by two friends, in which the attendees bring a book that will be taken home by another guest. I had several strong candidates from titles I read this year, but after deliberation, I opted for this one. Early in this book, Graeber (who passed away in 2020) takes up the task of demolishing the classic story we're told about the invention of money, that is: humanity invented money to dispense with the bartering problem. While this tale seems facially logical, Graeber observes that we don't really have evidence to support the claim. Coins have the property of being archaeologically durable; we can recover them as clues to how people from previous times lived. However, customs and practices that 
    
    - archaeologically, coins are easier to track and study, but this doesn't mean that coins emerged before credit systems
    - most importantly, money/currency emerges from states
    - soldiers need to be paid, plunder needs to be redeemable
    - history has moved through cycles in which virtual currency has been the normal
