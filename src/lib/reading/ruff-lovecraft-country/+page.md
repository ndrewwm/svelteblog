This was a good one. I think it'd make a fantastic a graphic novel in the pulp comic style from the era the book is set in. It feels appropriate that the book was picked up for adaptation into a mini-series; its episodic narrative feels really appropriate for TV as a medium. Ruff's storytelling is masterful in how it blends the fantastical elements of the fictional mythos it draws upon, but also in how it surfaces the real and pernicious horrors of segregated US society in the mid 20th century. The middle chapter, <em>"Jekyll in Hyde Park"</em>, is a great example of this.
