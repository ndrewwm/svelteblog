Hi there, I'm Andrew. I'm a data practitioner, with expertise in data engineering, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I currently work within the Data Services unit at CU-Boulder.

I'm passionate about social science and statistics, as well as their intersection. My academic background is in Psychology, but I am close to completing a second degree in applied mathematics. In line with these interests, my toolkit includes the R language, Python, SQL, Observable Plot, git/github, and many other technologies. I'm constantly working on learning new things; currently my interest is building my front-end skills in JS, using technologies such as `svelte` (with which this site was built).

You can reach me on LinkedIn and GitHub.
