This is another book I read as part of a book club. Jenny had also wanted me to read this one for a while. In *Song*, Miller is able to coax newly tragic threads from one of the most retold stories in western culture. The novel follows the life of Patroclus, Achilles's lover and companion, from boyhood to his mortal end on the battlefields of the Trojan war. A connection between *Circe* and *Song* is the pain that stems from children being different or below the expectations that their parents set out for them. By crafting the narrative over the entire lifetime of the book's protagonists, we see an Achilles whose divine-born gifts and prophesized glory are burden handed down from the gods and his wounded mother. I've never been disappointed by Miller's work; if you've only read *Circe*, definitely pick this one up.
