> "'Find the strength to do both,'" Mosscap said, quoting the phrase painted on the wagon.
> 
> "Exactly," Dex said.
> 
> "But what's _both_?"
> 
> Dex recited: "'Without constructs, you will unravel few mysteries. Without knowledge of the mysteries, your constructs will fail. These pursuits are what make us, but without comfort, you will lack the strength to sustain either.'"
> 
> "Is that from your Insights?" Mosscap asked.
> 
> "Yeah," Dex said. "But the thing is, the Child Gods aren't actively involved in our lives. They're ... not like that. They can't break the Parent Gods' laws. They provide inspiration, not intervention. If we want change, or good fortune, or solace, we have to create it for ourselves.

I read this one in a single sitting on a two-hour flight. The world of _Psalm_ is a more advanced version of our own; in most ways you can think of, the book is a softer and more relaxed kind of science fiction. The book's human society is living on a world known as "Panga". Perhaps this world is a terraformed planet, or a rechristened Earth, but this is left unsaid. Chambers doesn't feel the need of elaborating on the planet's relationship to ours, if there is one. However, a chief distinction of the setting is that human society has witnessed and experienced a genuine revolution.

The book doesn't need such terminology, but we might say that Panga is "post-singularity". Centuries before our narrative begins, we're told of the _"the Transition"_, in which robots working in human factories spontaneously became sentient. Humanity offers the newly self-aware robots membership (or citizenship) in their society, but the robots decline and depart to the Pangan wilderness. In what I think best exemplifies the book's fundamentally optimistic orientation and tone, humanity respects this choice, and goes on to reorganize its economy and patterns of settlement. This feature of the world's history is so different from common tropes concerning encounters between human and machine conciousnesses.

Despite the intriguing world that Chambers weaves in the prologue, its shape is only gradually revealed to us. _Psalm's_ narrative focuses on Sibling Dex, a monk whose order is dedicated to Allalae, the child god of small comforts. We learn that Panga has only one city, and that bicycles (Ox engines) are the primary form of transit. All of this is revealed through Dex's decision to leave the rooftop gardens of their temple to become a traveling tea monk. We're surrounded by a world that's vastly different from our own, but its human problems are familiar. Dex is a kindly soul, but they feel restless, unfulfilled, and burnt out.

Over the first and second chapters, we see Dex master the practice of serving tea, building a list of fans that eagerly await Dex's scheduled visits to their towns. In another small way that _Psalm's_ world differs from ours, Dex's character is nonbinary, and we don't have strong indications of this being unusual or stigmatized in the places that Dex visits. This isn't a book where a someone's queerness is treated as a source of conflict, or implicated in why a character feels out of place in the society they live in. But, Dex's presentation has some continuity with the second principal character: the wild-built robot called Mosscap, an agender being.

Science fiction is maybe uniquely positioned to imagine interactions between humanity and other modes of existence. This is true going all the way back to Shelley; _Psalm_ easily falls into this tradition, but again, it's constructive and optimistic in the way it does so. An early exchange between the book's main characters helps illustrate this:

> A chatterbird alighted on a nearby branch, singing its famous staccato song. Mosscap smiled and returned the cal, mimicking the sound in near perfection.
>
> Dex looked askance at the robot as they pedaled. "That's creepily good", they said.
> 
> "Two Foxes taught me," Mosscap said.
> 
> Dex wrinkled their nose in confusion. "Two foxes taught you to-- Is that another robot?"
> 
> "Yes. Two Foxes is an expert in bird behavior. It loves nothing better than listening to vocalizations."
> 
> Dex took note of Mosscap's phrasing. "So, it is correct then? You wouldn't prefer _they_ or--"
>
> "Oh, no, no, no. Those sorts of words are for people. Robots are not people. We're machines, and machines are objects. Objects are _its_."
> 
> "I'd say you're more than just an object," Dex said.
> 
> The robot looked a touch offended. "I would never call you _just_ an animal, Sibling Dex." It turned its gaze to the road, head held high. "We don't have to fall into the same category to be of equal value."

I like how this encounter nudges you/Dex to consider other ways of being. ...

- Via Mosscap, Chambers is able to pull apart aspects of human perspective that often go unquestioned
  - mosscap is ... "childlike", but perhaps a better term is that it's _unburdened_
  - young in consciousness, there's no pretense that existence requires anything more than experiencing the world, and respect for one's fellow inhabitants
  - "it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don't need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just _live_."
  - "Do you not find consciousness alone to be the most exhilarating thing?"

- After talking about the book with others, I'm reminded a lot of another robot character, Levi, from the _Scavengers Reign_ series.
