Here is some sci-fi that I think might struggle to be adapted to TV/film, but is so worth picking up and devouring. This book has some fairly unusual protagonists, but Tchaikovsky's strengths are illustrated in helping the audience to empathize with them. The book has the good bones of sci-fi world building, and its chapters feel snappy, despite its narrative taking place over thousands of years.
