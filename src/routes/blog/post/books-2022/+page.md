### *Necropolitics*, Achille Mbembe

### *Lovecraft Country*, Matt Ruff

This was a good one. I'd really like to see this adapted as a graphic novel in the pulp comic style.

### *Exit West*, Mohsin Hamid

### *Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science*, Charles Wheelan, Burton G. Malkiel

This was given to me as a Christmas gift. I remember finding out the author (Wheelan) was a regular contributor to *the Economist* and feeling like that explained a lot. I would recommend *Economics: The User's Guide* by Ha-Joon Chang over this one, I think.

### *Dune Messiah*, Frank Herbert

I read *Dune* for the first time in 2021.

### *Children of Dune*, Frank Herbert

### *The Korean War: A History*, Bruce Cummings
