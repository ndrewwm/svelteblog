I wish I had finished this book before heading to Spain! I would've had additional questions for our guides. The focus of Graham's book is not military history-- its goal is to detail the war's causes, the experiences of the Spanish people, and its aftermath.

One gets a sense for the course of the war, but not through descriptions of how armies maneuvered. Instead, Graham concentrates on the more important factors, specifically how the respective factions assembled and supplied their armies. Before reading, I had a cursory understanding of the war's events: a coup in the officer corps was able to embed itself in eastern Spain, and (via assistance from fascist states) experienced soldiers from Morocco were airlifted to serve as the core of the nationalists' forces. The Republic initially repelled the Nationalist advance to Madrid, but was defeated in the north, presaging their eventual defeat in the west. However, I'd been underappreciating the degree to which diplomatic factors determined the course of the war. I was aware of the International Brigades and German/Italian support for the Nationalists, but Graham highlights how a jointly dishonest pact of "non-intervention" between Britain, France, and Germany hamstrung the Republican government's ability to acquire materiel needed to defend itself. This same policy also prevented the Republic from searching German and Italian ships that were covertly delivering weapons to the Nationalists.

- trigger: military coup of July 1936
- origins: many
  - uneven development
  - Spain mostly agrarian, loss of empire (& captive market) leads to questions of how the country should modernize
  - coup unleashed a series of culture wars:
    - urban & cosmopolitan lifestyle vs. rural & traditional (la Espana profunda)
    - secular vs. religious
    - authoritarianism vs. liberal political cultures
    - center vs. periphery
    - traditional gender roles vs. the concept of the 'new woman'
  - manichaen belief in the authority of the church
    - liberalism contesting Catholic church's monopoly on truth
    - monarchy seen as best form of government to protect existing order
  - rigid & intolerant military ideology developed by _Afrikanistas_ in Spain's officer corps

- Spanish republic emerged peacefully in spring of 1931, after the end of a military dictatorship
  - political class: progressive republicans (middle class teachers and lawyers), socialist movement (urban workers)
  - goals: structural reforms for land ownership, education, state-church relations, and the army
