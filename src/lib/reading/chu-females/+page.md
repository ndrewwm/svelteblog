I first encountered Chu's writing through her essay in <em>N+1</em>, <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-30/essays/on-liking-women/"><em>"On Liking Women"</em></a>. Chu's essay recounts her first encounters with Valerie Solanas's <em>S.C.U.M. Manifesto</em> and its influence on her thinking. Solanas is threaded within each chapter of <em>Females</em>, and as this might lead one to expect, the book feels like an extension topics that Chu touches in the essay. Chu's writing is frequently funny, and usually leaves me feeling like I'm seeing a topic from a new place. These qualities seem appropriate for a book whose thesis is "everyone is female".
