Before reading this book, if you'd asked me what most people know about the Civil War, I would've answered with something like the following:

- people remember the war primarily for its impact: the installation and oppressions of Francoism;
- Francoism is a sibling of German and Italian forms of fascism appearing in interwar Europe; and
- for travelers on the political left, one's description of the war's course is something of a shibboleth.

I think the above are correct, but Graham's book has prepared me to contextualize each a bit better. The focus of Graham's book is not military history. As she says, the book's purpose is to "explain the Civil War, its causes, course, and consequences", both domestically and internationally.

I feel I learned the most with regards to the pre-war period. Spain's empire was essentially gone by 1898, and this had several important effects. First, loss of its colonies meant Spain no longer had a captive market for its goods, triggering difficult political debates over how the country should modernize. Spain's economy was still mostly agricultural, aside from a few industrialized cities (specifically in the northern regions, and in Barcelona). It was uncommon for the rural poor to have their own holdings, and most earned their sole income from working the estates of large landowners. Second, without an empire to police, the military's traditional role of external defense was displaced.

Upon the second republic's emergence in 1931 (following the military dictatorship of Primo de Rivera), the new government's goal was structural reform. Namely, it intended to reduce expenses by trimming the bloated officer corps, and reforming the military to ensure constitutional control. A secular education system was to be established; traditionally, the Catholic Church was responsible for public education, and clergy were compensated by the state for this role. Lastly, the Republican government wanted to stimulate industrial development within the country. To achieve this, they planned to use agrarian reform to increase the purchasing power of average citizens, thus cultivating an internal market. In substance, these pillars were meant to establish basic features of a politically liberal and economically democratic society. However, as Graham details, these reforms clearly interfered with traditional bases of power within Spanish society.

The Republican government was able to pass legislation, but its implementation was frequently resisted. Police personnel frequently held clientelistic relationships with local elites, and thus refused to enforce laws. Landowners refused to recognize redistributive social welfare initiatives, and left fields uncultivated. Elite hostility to reform and frustration from the landless poor increased the political temperature in the South, at the same time that the Great Depression was reaching Europe. The depression created further stress in urban Spain; unemployment and frustration due to state repression boiled over in an attempted general strike during 1934. The uprising was most intense in northern Asturias, and was violently supressed by colonial troops from Spanish Morocco (deployed under orders of Franco). Over 30,000 people were imprisoned in the aftermath; many were tortured. PSOE and union offices were closed, and those with left-leaning sympathies were discriminated against or fired en-masse. Here's some of Graham's analysis regarding the October Revolution:

> The events of October 1934 are often cited by historians as evidence that the Spanish Left could not be trusted to play by the democratic rules. But this assessment takes no account of the complexity of the events leading to October – not least the conservative government’s own flouting of the law as it sought to brake or reverse social reform. It also ignores the obvious lesson to be drawn from what happened in Asturias: that, in fact, the Left had no other option but to work for social change through legal, parliamentary channels. For in any showdown of physical force it simply could not prevail.

In 1936, a coalition of the Spanish Left regained power, promising to complete the reform program it had attempted between 1931-33. This electoral failure appears to have stimulated plans within Spain's insular officer corps to pursue a military coup, which was carried out in July of 1936, triggering the broader Spanish Civil War. Outwardly, the military/nationalists claimed the coup was meant to stave off communist revolution, but this is disingenous. It's clear the coup was an extralegal means to continue resisting social change, following the Right's electoral failure.

This detail, and Graham's observation that the pre-war period saw the development of a mix of culture wars (rural vs. urban life, secularity vs. religion, authoritarianism vs. political liberalism, traditional gender roles vs. the "new woman") felt chilling to read from a book written in 2005. To an important degree, the Spanish Civil War was kindled by antipathy for the experience of societal change. Unlike the Russian Revolution, a civil war emerging from the country's disastrous involvement in the first world war (and an entailing famine), the Spanish Civil War was triggered by reactionary fears of status loss and disruption to traditional social order. My home country has been unable to exorcise right-wing anxieties over racial pluralism and tolerance for diverse expressions of gender and sexuality. In the past decade, the US has even experienced a failed autogolpe. To summarize, a substantial degree of recent conflict in the US stems from similar antipathies towards social change.

- "non-intervention" -> the republic didn't fail due to disunity, it was always on the back foot
- memory culture

One gets a sense for the course of the war, but not through descriptions of how armies maneuvered. Instead, Graham concentrates on the more important factors, specifically how the respective factions assembled and supplied their armies. Before reading, I had a cursory understanding of the war's events: a coup in the officer corps was able to embed itself in eastern Spain, and (via assistance from fascist states) experienced soldiers from Morocco were airlifted to serve as the core of the nationalists' forces. The Republic initially repelled the Nationalist advance to Madrid, but was defeated in the north, presaging their eventual defeat in the west. However, I'd been underappreciating the degree to which diplomatic factors determined the course of the war. I was aware of the International Brigades and German/Italian support for the Nationalists, but Graham highlights how a jointly dishonest pact of "non-intervention" between Britain, France, and Germany hamstrung the Republican government's ability to acquire materiel needed to defend itself. This same policy also prevented the Republic from searching German and Italian ships that were covertly delivering weapons to the Nationalists.

- trigger: military coup of July 1936
- origins: many
  - uneven development
  - Spain mostly agrarian, loss of empire (& captive market) leads to questions of how the country should modernize
  - coup unleashed a series of culture wars:
    - urban & cosmopolitan lifestyle vs. rural & traditional (la Espana profunda)
    - secular vs. religious
    - authoritarianism vs. liberal political cultures
    - center vs. periphery
    - traditional gender roles vs. the concept of the 'new woman'
  - manichaen belief in the authority of the church
    - liberalism contesting Catholic church's monopoly on truth
    - monarchy seen as best form of government to protect existing order
  - rigid & intolerant military ideology developed by _Afrikanistas_ in Spain's officer corps

- Spanish republic emerged peacefully in spring of 1931, after the end of a military dictatorship
  - political class: progressive republicans (middle class teachers and lawyers), socialist movement (urban workers)
  - goals: structural reforms for land ownership, education, state-church relations, and the army
