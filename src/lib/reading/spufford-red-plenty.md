This one mingles science fiction, history, and a novel together to tell some stories of what the Soviets hoped to realize after Stalin's death. Paraphrasing, Spufford says the book's protagonist is the <em>idea of the planned economy</em>, and the book serves to introduce us to people it encounters along the way; some people aiding it, others hindering it, until it meets the end of its life.
