      Hi! I'm glad you're reading my blog. This page is here to provide some basic caveats for what
      you'll find here:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, the views expressed here are <em>solely my own,</em> and <em>should not</em>
        be assumed to reflect the opinions or endorsement of my employer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, my writing spans various topics and while I strive to be accurate in what I
        post, I'm human and may make occasional mistakes. Additionally, I try to ensure
        I've included adequate links, citations, and credit to works that I reference. I welcome
        feedback/corrections with regards to either of the these matters.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to visit <a href="/contact">/contact</a> for methods to reach me.
